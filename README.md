# Antity

## Project
Antity is a play on words for the Entity Component System (ECS), I will personally be working on this engine to later develop games with it.

For its first couple of iterations this engine will **NOT** be generic enough to be used as an actual engine. 
This is more of a test to learn about creating engines.
